Personal configuration files. Inside you will find:

#### Desktop Environment

I'm currently trying out BSPWM, based off some of the awesome stuff over on
[/r/unixporn/](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn). Currently still using XMonad
for work and on laptop setups.

* XMonad
    * dzen2
    * conky
    * dmenu

* bspwm

#### Programming Related

* zsh, tmux, urxvt
* vim
    * with lots of plugins... for a non-plugin guy

Install
-------

... install script coming soon(tm). More likely coming never. I currently
run arch on all of my systems, so a generic install script isn't in the cards.
Check what the [install.sh](install.sh) script is doing to get a gist of what
needs to be done.
